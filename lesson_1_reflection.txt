How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    while comparing the changes of both files we can able see the changes.Like we can say which lines are changed and check that changed lines for bugs instead of checking all lines in the files for bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   Say in an organization many people edit the same file so if we have access to history of all versions we able see what changed made by whome/after you changed/time of changed,etc., it help us to understand the project development with version control.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    since we can able to commit multiple files it is easy for developer change the files that are related to one another and save them.but some times we need to commit specific files like in google docs since their not depend on other that is waste of memory
